# Plan for User System Implementation

## UI Components
- [x] Create a narrow sidebar/toolbar component for the left side of the main interface
- [x] Design and implement user avatar component for the bottom left corner
- [x] Create login modal component with Google and GitHub authentication options
- [x] Implement settings button that appears below avatar after login
- [x] Design settings modal with tabs for model settings and search provider settings

## Authentication
- [x] Research and set up Google OAuth integration (implemented with mock login functionality)
- [x] Research and set up GitHub OAuth integration (implemented with mock login functionality)
- [x] Implement login state management
- [x] Create utility functions to fetch and display user avatars from OAuth providers
- [x] Add visual indicator (green dot) for avatar when user profile image is unavailable

## Settings Management
- [x] Create tabbed interface for settings modal (Model tab and Search Provider tab)
- [x] Implement form for LLM settings (model name, Base URL, API Key)
- [x] Create collapsible section for vision model settings with default value inheritance from LLM settings
- [x] Implement dropdown for search provider selection (Tavily, Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing)
- [x] Add conditional API Key field that appears when Tavily is selected

## Data Storage
- [x] Set up IndexedDB for local storage of user settings
- [x] Create data models for user preferences
- [x] Implement functions to save/retrieve user settings
- [x] Add utilities to initialize default settings for new users

## Integration
- [x] Connect authentication state to UI components
- [x] Link settings data to the backend API calls
- [x] Ensure user settings persist between sessions
- [x] Test the complete login and settings workflow

## Edge Cases
- [x] Handle authentication errors and retries
- [x] Implement proper error handling for API key validation
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms when OAuth providers are unavailable
- [x] Consider privacy and security best practices for storing API keys
